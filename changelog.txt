Updated to use Fireplace Lib 5.5.0+
Restructured configs to more closely match the format of the Config GUI - it's not ideal, but it'll do for now since it's more maintainable. Will likely restructure again to be more like the original after FL 6.0.0 is released.
Internally reworked configs to be more maintainable.
Removed Compact Custom Mob Configs option
